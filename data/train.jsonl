Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

One such transaction involving a payment to Brad Clay was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 5621 Courtney Circles\nJohnsonmouth, TN 32771 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Charles and Sons should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Perez-Adams should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Adams PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 785 Amanda Motorway\nJohntown, VI 02412.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements.

{"id": "utt_1588", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Acosta, Austin and Hansen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Acosta, Austin and Hansen was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 1775 Michael Coves\nNew Christineborough, OH 88725 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 031-06-8845 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Acosta, Austin and Hansen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 1775 Michael Coves\nNew Christineborough, OH 88725 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.adams.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 031-06-8845 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 031-06-8845, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Brittany Wilkerson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 1775 Michael Coves\nNew Christineborough, OH 88725 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Acosta, Austin and Hansen should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Brittany Wilkerson at melindaboyd@example.com or +75 9653558038. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 1775 Michael Coves\nNew Christineborough, OH 88725.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Acosta, Austin and Hansen remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3461, "end": 3479, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5128, "end": 5146, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5150, "end": 5173, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5177, "end": 5191, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 932, "end": 981, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2099, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3725, "end": 3774, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5254, "end": 5303, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 105, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 443, "end": 468, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2025, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4982, "end": 5007, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5359, "end": 5384, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Garcia Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 565 Price Fords\nVictoriaborough, OR 32228. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics.

{"id": "utt_1623", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Hernandez Ltd for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Hernandez Ltd are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial reporting process.

{"id": "utt_1624", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Rodriguez, Carter and Barker for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Rodriguez, Carter and Barker was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 361 Hebert Corner Apt. 658\nPort Joshua, GU 39600 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 830-63-2189 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Rodriguez, Carter and Barker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 361 Hebert Corner Apt. 658\nPort Joshua, GU 39600 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://cunningham-jenkins.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 830-63-2189 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 830-63-2189, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Darren Johnston was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 361 Hebert Corner Apt. 658\nPort Joshua, GU 39600 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Rodriguez, Carter and Barker should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Darren Johnston at maria11@example.org or +397 6675748015. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 361 Hebert Corner Apt. 658\nPort Joshua, GU 39600.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Rodriguez, Carter and Barker remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3476, "end": 3491, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5142, "end": 5157, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5161, "end": 5180, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5184, "end": 5199, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 938, "end": 986, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2106, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3737, "end": 3785, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5262, "end": 5310, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 108, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 446, "end": 474, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2033, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4993, "end": 5021, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5366, "end": 5394, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Jones Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 44792 Richard Shoals Suite 548\nMcdonaldfort, PA 34011.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics.

{"id": "utt_1659", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Hernandez Group for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Hernandez Group are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial reporting process.

{"id": "utt_1660", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Walters-Crawford for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Walters-Crawford was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 03978 Kayla Shoals\nGillespiebury, FL 53190 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 836-53-9661 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Walters-Crawford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 03978 Kayla Shoals\nGillespiebury, FL 53190 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.moore.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 836-53-9661 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 836-53-9661, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Heather Clay was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 03978 Kayla Shoals\nGillespiebury, FL 53190 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Walters-Crawford should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Heather Clay at cynthiamaxwell@example.net or +91 9596133345. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 03978 Kayla Shoals\nGillespiebury, FL 53190.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Walters-Crawford remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3419, "end": 3431, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5064, "end": 5076, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5080, "end": 5106, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5110, "end": 5124, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 914, "end": 956, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2016, "end": 2058, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3677, "end": 3719, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5187, "end": 5229, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 96, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 434, "end": 450, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1991, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4927, "end": 4943, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5285, "end": 5301, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Thompson-Byrd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 07488 Avery Divide Suite 328\nNorth Darleneborough, RI 81755.

{"id": "utt_1696", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Crosby-Watkins for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Crosby-Watkins was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 53703 Angela Unions\nCandaceberg, KY 35904 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 760-16-3707 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Crosby-Watkins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 53703 Angela Unions\nCandaceberg, KY 35904 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://taylor.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 760-16-3707 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 760-16-3707, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Christina Briggs was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 53703 Angela Unions\nCandaceberg, KY 35904 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Crosby-Watkins should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Christina Briggs at tmiller@example.net or +94 3671639606. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 53703 Angela Unions\nCandaceberg, KY 35904.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Crosby-Watkins remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3408, "end": 3424, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5054, "end": 5070, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5074, "end": 5093, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5097, "end": 5111, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 910, "end": 951, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2050, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3670, "end": 3711, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5174, "end": 5215, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 94, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 432, "end": 446, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1970, "end": 1984, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4919, "end": 4933, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5271, "end": 5285, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Morgan, Landry and Dixon, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 3325 Karen Lodge\nLeeberg, ID 68767.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_1732", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Ibarra, Smith and Avila for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Ibarra, Smith and Avila was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 8295 Clark Cliff Suite 439\nEast Katrinafurt, MD 85236 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 150-59-1991 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Ibarra, Smith and Avila\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 8295 Clark Cliff Suite 439\nEast Katrinafurt, MD 85236 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.jackson.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 150-59-1991 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 150-59-1991, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Marc Jones was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 8295 Clark Cliff Suite 439\nEast Katrinafurt, MD 85236 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Ibarra, Smith and Avila should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Marc Jones at anthonycunningham@example.org or +207 3165758739. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 8295 Clark Cliff Suite 439\nEast Katrinafurt, MD 85236.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Ibarra, Smith and Avila remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3465, "end": 3475, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5126, "end": 5136, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5140, "end": 5169, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5173, "end": 5188, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 928, "end": 981, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2101, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3721, "end": 3774, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5251, "end": 5304, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 103, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 441, "end": 464, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2023, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4982, "end": 5005, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5360, "end": 5383, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Phillips Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 76141 Holly Ville Apt. 843\nKnightton, GU 26854.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_1768", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Morales, Harmon and Crawford for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Morales, Harmon and Crawford was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 421 Henry Spur\nCourtneystad, MO 37169 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 301-59-1313 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Morales, Harmon and Crawford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 421 Henry Spur\nCourtneystad, MO 37169 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.khan.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 301-59-1313 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 301-59-1313, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Adam Gillespie was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 421 Henry Spur\nCourtneystad, MO 37169 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Morales, Harmon and Crawford should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Adam Gillespie at samanthajones@example.net or +45 6045456748. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 421 Henry Spur\nCourtneystad, MO 37169.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Morales, Harmon and Crawford remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3445, "end": 3459, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5099, "end": 5113, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5117, "end": 5142, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5146, "end": 5160, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 938, "end": 975, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2084, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3705, "end": 3742, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5223, "end": 5260, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 108, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 446, "end": 474, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1994, "end": 2022, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4950, "end": 4978, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5316, "end": 5344, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Santos PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 65621 Walls Fords Apt. 466\nFraziermouth, MP 91391.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_1804", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Jones-Smith for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Jones-Smith was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 203 David Common Apt. 699\nJohnburgh, IA 35741 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 570-88-1311 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Jones-Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 203 David Common Apt. 699\nJohnburgh, IA 35741 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://ward.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 570-88-1311 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 570-88-1311, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Abigail Oneal was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 203 David Common Apt. 699\nJohnburgh, IA 35741 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Jones-Smith should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Abigail Oneal at grant49@example.org or +65 3022046334. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 203 David Common Apt. 699\nJohnburgh, IA 35741.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Jones-Smith remains compliant with all tax regulations.

Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Downs, Pena and Williams, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 170 Fitzpatrick Manors\nFosterton, VI 95139.

{"id": "utt_1840", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Gonzalez, Foster and Hunter for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Gonzalez, Foster and Hunter was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 392 Sergio Falls\nPort Amber, AS 20480 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 144-56-3688 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Gonzalez, Foster and Hunter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 392 Sergio Falls\nPort Amber, AS 20480 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://walker.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 144-56-3688 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 144-56-3688, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Clinton Walsh was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 392 Sergio Falls\nPort Amber, AS 20480 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Gonzalez, Foster and Hunter should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Clinton Walsh at phillipsamy@example.org or +91 6790941509. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 392 Sergio Falls\nPort Amber, AS 20480.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Gonzalez, Foster and Hunter remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3440, "end": 3453, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5092, "end": 5105, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5109, "end": 5132, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5136, "end": 5150, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 936, "end": 973, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2081, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3699, "end": 3736, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5213, "end": 5250, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 107, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 445, "end": 472, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 2019, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4944, "end": 4971, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5306, "end": 5333, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Robinson-Woodard, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 00629 Schmidt Garden Apt. 188\nLake Philipville, AS 82319.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Wong-Jackson, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 672 Lisa Lane\nRichardfort, OR 17316.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_1912", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Tate, Rice and Howard for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Tate, Rice and Howard was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 58554 Karina Throughway\nNicoletown, GA 94265 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 081-02-9793 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Tate, Rice and Howard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 58554 Karina Throughway\nNicoletown, GA 94265 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://warner.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 081-02-9793 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 081-02-9793, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Jennifer Cline was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 58554 Karina Throughway\nNicoletown, GA 94265 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Tate, Rice and Howard should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Jennifer Cline at stephanie37@example.org or +31 8571544001. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 58554 Karina Throughway\nNicoletown, GA 94265.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Tate, Rice and Howard remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Baker-Lawson, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 526 Dean Camp\nKristinaport, FM 07240.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics.

{"id": "utt_1948", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Davenport-Joseph for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Davenport-Joseph was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 2605 Saunders Crossing\nArmstrongland, IA 59574 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 310-84-4131 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Davenport-Joseph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 2605 Saunders Crossing\nArmstrongland, IA 59574 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://bailey.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 310-84-4131 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 310-84-4131, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Tracy Robertson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 2605 Saunders Crossing\nArmstrongland, IA 59574 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Davenport-Joseph should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Tracy Robertson at valdezstacy@example.net or +330 8270318140.

{"id": "utt_1984", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Lopez, Jordan and Allen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Lopez, Jordan and Allen was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 2997 Cline Prairie Suite 255\nSmithchester, CO 90573 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 353-49-7337 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Lopez, Jordan and Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 2997 Cline Prairie Suite 255\nSmithchester, CO 90573 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://werner.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 353-49-7337 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 353-49-7337, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Brandi Savage was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 2997 Cline Prairie Suite 255\nSmithchester, CO 90573 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Clark-Lee was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at Unit 5217 Box 7531\nDPO AP 21465 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 553-73-6089 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Clark-Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at Unit 5217 Box 7531\nDPO AP 21465 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.gomez.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 553-73-6089 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 553-73-6089, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Kimberly Diaz was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at Unit 5217 Box 7531\nDPO AP 21465 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Clark-Lee should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Kimberly Diaz at reynoldsgregory@example.com or +808 7870105836. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at Unit 5217 Box 7531\nDPO AP 21465.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Clark-Lee remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3376, "end": 3389, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5004, "end": 5017, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5021, "end": 5048, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5052, "end": 5067, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 900, "end": 931, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 2015, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3635, "end": 3666, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5130, "end": 5161, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 89, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 427, "end": 436, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1959, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4874, "end": 4883, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5217, "end": 5226, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Jones, Patterson and Garcia, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 54106 Gary Rapid Apt. 518\nHollyport, TN 91745.

{"id": "utt_2056", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Cardenas-Hall for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Cardenas-Hall was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 6054 Rocha Ramp\nStuartshire, GU 82858 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 312-20-6184 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Cardenas-Hall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 6054 Rocha Ramp\nStuartshire, GU 82858 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.evans.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 312-20-6184 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 312-20-6184, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Kimberly Parker was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 6054 Rocha Ramp\nStuartshire, GU 82858 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Cardenas-Hall should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Kimberly Parker at zhoward@example.net or +91 8782820195. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 6054 Rocha Ramp\nStuartshire, GU 82858.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Cardenas-Hall remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3401, "end": 3416, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5041, "end": 5056, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5060, "end": 5079, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5083, "end": 5097, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 908, "end": 945, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2039, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3662, "end": 3699, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5160, "end": 5197, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 93, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 431, "end": 444, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1977, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4907, "end": 4920, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5253, "end": 5266, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Baker, Harper and Moran, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 683 Troy Forge Suite 431\nGlennborough, MS 21661.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

{"id": "utt_2092", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Byrd, Yates and Harris for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Byrd, Yates and Harris was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 693 Meyer Ports\nTammyhaven, WV 72928 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 170-90-1032 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Byrd, Yates and Harris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 693 Meyer Ports\nTammyhaven, WV 72928 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://wu.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 170-90-1032 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 170-90-1032, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Raymond Mcdaniel was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 693 Meyer Ports\nTammyhaven, WV 72928 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Byrd, Yates and Harris should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Raymond Mcdaniel at ianmartin@example.org or +13 1272593067. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 693 Meyer Ports\nTammyhaven, WV 72928.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Byrd, Yates and Harris remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3419, "end": 3435, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5068, "end": 5084, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5088, "end": 5109, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5113, "end": 5127, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 926, "end": 962, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2064, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3681, "end": 3717, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5190, "end": 5226, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 102, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 440, "end": 462, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 2003, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4925, "end": 4947, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5282, "end": 5304, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Andrews-Brown, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 653 Zoe Garden Apt. 995\nSavannahshire, CT 35060.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Lindsey, Dominguez and Lucas are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial reporting process.

{"id": "utt_2128", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Randall LLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Randall LLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 10185 Mosley Falls Suite 868\nMariafurt, RI 95371 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 416-64-7302 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Randall LLC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 10185 Mosley Falls Suite 868\nMariafurt, RI 95371 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://huerta.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 416-64-7302 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 416-64-7302, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Phillip Carter was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 10185 Mosley Falls Suite 868\nMariafurt, RI 95371 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Randall LLC should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Phillip Carter at michelle56@example.org or +91 7436238013. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 10185 Mosley Falls Suite 868\nMariafurt, RI 95371.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Randall LLC remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Thornton, Murphy and Frey, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 0757 Christopher Ports Suite 197\nSouth Kevinstad, HI 44691. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period.

{"id": "utt_2163", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Rice LLC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Rice LLC are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial reporting process.

{"id": "utt_2164", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Lopez-Hall for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Lopez-Hall was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 62737 Wood Lodge Suite 528\nWest Daniel, KY 03732 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 248-09-7334 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Lopez-Hall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 62737 Wood Lodge Suite 528\nWest Daniel, KY 03732 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.kirk.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 248-09-7334 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 248-09-7334, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to William Williams was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 62737 Wood Lodge Suite 528\nWest Daniel, KY 03732 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Lopez-Hall should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact William Williams at nathan98@example.org or +83 5261515323. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 62737 Wood Lodge Suite 528\nWest Daniel, KY 03732.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Lopez-Hall remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3413, "end": 3429, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5062, "end": 5078, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5082, "end": 5102, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5106, "end": 5120, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 902, "end": 950, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2004, "end": 2052, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3675, "end": 3723, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5183, "end": 5231, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 90, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 428, "end": 438, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1979, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4931, "end": 4941, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5287, "end": 5297, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Alvarez, Davis and Dawson, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 268 Johnson Underpass Suite 497\nNew Charles, RI 91034. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics.

{"id": "utt_2199", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Sanchez-Stokes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

The management and Board of Directors of Sanchez-Stokes are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

{"id": "utt_2200", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Richmond, Salinas and Obrien for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Richmond, Salinas and Obrien was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 96106 Katherine Ports\nPerezchester, AS 65801 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 800-02-9954 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Richmond, Salinas and Obrien\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 96106 Katherine Ports\nPerezchester, AS 65801 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.wright.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 800-02-9954 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 800-02-9954, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Tommy Montgomery was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 96106 Katherine Ports\nPerezchester, AS 65801 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Richmond, Salinas and Obrien should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Tommy Montgomery at xnicholson@example.net or +91 1445889633. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 96106 Katherine Ports\nPerezchester, AS 65801.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Richmond, Salinas and Obrien remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3461, "end": 3477, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5124, "end": 5140, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5144, "end": 5166, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5170, "end": 5184, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 938, "end": 982, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2054, "end": 2098, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3723, "end": 3767, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5247, "end": 5291, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 108, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 446, "end": 474, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2001, "end": 2029, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4975, "end": 5003, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5347, "end": 5375, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2236", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Livingston Inc for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Livingston Inc was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at USNS Thomas\nFPO AP 92935 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 350-75-9725 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Livingston Inc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at USNS Thomas\nFPO AP 92935 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.nunez-taylor.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 350-75-9725 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 350-75-9725, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Stephanie Lawson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at USNS Thomas\nFPO AP 92935 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Livingston Inc should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Stephanie Lawson at glandry@example.org or +48 4519145723. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at USNS Thomas\nFPO AP 92935.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Livingston Inc remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3385, "end": 3401, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5014, "end": 5030, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5034, "end": 5053, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5057, "end": 5071, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 910, "end": 934, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 2016, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3647, "end": 3671, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5134, "end": 5158, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 94, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 432, "end": 446, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1967, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4879, "end": 4893, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5214, "end": 5228, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Freeman Inc, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 404 John Lane\nPort Lorifurt, WY 96281. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period.

{"id": "utt_2272", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Schmitt, Gomez and Vincent for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Schmitt, Gomez and Vincent was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 7344 Johnson Street Apt. 734\nWest Robertmouth, WI 29331 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 052-69-8892 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Schmitt, Gomez and Vincent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 7344 Johnson Street Apt. 734\nWest Robertmouth, WI 29331 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://jones-brown.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 052-69-8892 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 052-69-8892, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Mrs. Sandra Mejia DDS was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 7344 Johnson Street Apt. 734\nWest Robertmouth, WI 29331 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Schmitt, Gomez and Vincent should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Mrs. Sandra Mejia DDS at haleyyates@example.org or +227 2380293234. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 7344 Johnson Street Apt. 734\nWest Robertmouth, WI 29331.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Schmitt, Gomez and Vincent remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3478, "end": 3499, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5155, "end": 5176, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5180, "end": 5202, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5206, "end": 5221, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 934, "end": 989, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2114, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3745, "end": 3800, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5284, "end": 5339, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 106, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 444, "end": 470, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2008, "end": 2034, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5008, "end": 5034, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5395, "end": 5421, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

{"id": "utt_2307", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Rich, Richardson and Camacho for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Rich, Richardson and Camacho are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

{"id": "utt_2308", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Campbell and Sons for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Campbell and Sons was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 39802 Walker Neck\nPort Andrea, AS 73050 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 615-15-4154 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Campbell and Sons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 39802 Walker Neck\nPort Andrea, AS 73050 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://fields.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 615-15-4154 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 615-15-4154, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Kristine Nelson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 39802 Walker Neck\nPort Andrea, AS 73050 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Campbell and Sons should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Kristine Nelson at sharongarcia@example.net or +91 0992487759. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 39802 Walker Neck\nPort Andrea, AS 73050.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Campbell and Sons remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3414, "end": 3429, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5060, "end": 5075, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5079, "end": 5103, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5107, "end": 5121, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 916, "end": 955, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2016, "end": 2055, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3675, "end": 3714, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5184, "end": 5223, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 97, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 435, "end": 452, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1991, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4922, "end": 4939, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5279, "end": 5296, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Rivers-Brown, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 185 Smith Valleys Suite 921\nAndersonshire, IL 37409.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements.

{"id": "utt_2344", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Williams Ltd for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Williams Ltd was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 89670 Bradley Ports Apt. 938\nLake Scottbury, SC 67590 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 148-50-5302 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Williams Ltd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 89670 Bradley Ports Apt. 938\nLake Scottbury, SC 67590 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://wells-flores.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 148-50-5302 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 148-50-5302, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Victor Shaffer was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 89670 Bradley Ports Apt. 938\nLake Scottbury, SC 67590 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Williams Ltd should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Victor Shaffer at tmiller@example.com or +221 4123402860. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 89670 Bradley Ports Apt. 938\nLake Scottbury, SC 67590.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Williams Ltd remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Alexander-Morrison, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 0092 Lyons Crossroad\nPort Robertview, SD 21377.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2380", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Coleman-Tucker for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Coleman-Tucker was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 5084 Fuller Heights\nWest Carl, PW 86086 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 108-81-9910 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Coleman-Tucker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 5084 Fuller Heights\nWest Carl, PW 86086 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.moore.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 108-81-9910 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 108-81-9910, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Alex Barnett was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 5084 Fuller Heights\nWest Carl, PW 86086 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Coleman-Tucker should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Alex Barnett at harrismichael@example.org or +41 8400929941. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 5084 Fuller Heights\nWest Carl, PW 86086.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Coleman-Tucker remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3408, "end": 3420, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5048, "end": 5060, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5064, "end": 5089, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5093, "end": 5107, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 910, "end": 949, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2007, "end": 2046, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3666, "end": 3705, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5170, "end": 5209, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 94, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 432, "end": 446, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1982, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4913, "end": 4927, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5265, "end": 5279, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Bell, Acosta and Martin, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 7821 Thomas Walk\nJonathanmouth, DC 05186.

Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2416", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Garcia, Lopez and Nguyen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Garcia, Lopez and Nguyen was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 2345 Jessica Extension Suite 766\nLake Jasminebury, PA 25735 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 359-80-1728 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Garcia, Lopez and Nguyen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 2345 Jessica Extension Suite 766\nLake Jasminebury, PA 25735 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://wwwmoorecom/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 359-80-1728 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 359-80-1728, were cross-checked with the HR records A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000 One such transaction involving a payment to Sarah Duncan was identified where TDS was not deducted The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 2345 Jessica Extension Suite 766\nLake Jasminebury, PA 25735 lacked proper documentation The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations The finance team at Garcia, Lopez and Nguyen should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Petty-Gutierrez, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 4400 Paul Ranch Apt. 735\nMonicaville, AS 23492.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2452", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Castro, Boyd and Murphy for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Castro, Boyd and Murphy was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at Unit 1296 Box 7377\nDPO AE 28158 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 794-28-3586 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Castro, Boyd and Murphy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at Unit 1296 Box 7377\nDPO AE 28158 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://freeman.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 794-28-3586 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 794-28-3586, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Levi Johnson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at Unit 1296 Box 7377\nDPO AE 28158 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Castro, Boyd and Murphy should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Levi Johnson at smitchell@example.com or +91 1925323768. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at Unit 1296 Box 7377\nDPO AE 28158.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Castro, Boyd and Murphy remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3416, "end": 3428, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5057, "end": 5069, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5073, "end": 5094, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5098, "end": 5112, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 928, "end": 959, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2057, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3674, "end": 3705, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5175, "end": 5206, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 103, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 441, "end": 464, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 2001, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4913, "end": 4936, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5262, "end": 5285, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Allen Group, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 4654 Herbert Summit Apt. 863\nLake Shirley, CT 68695.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2488", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Garza-Mullins for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Garza-Mullins was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at PSC 8893, Box 3625\nAPO AE 94300 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 756-81-7959 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Garza-Mullins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at PSC 8893, Box 3625\nAPO AE 94300 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.baxter-sparks.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 756-81-7959 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 756-81-7959, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Jeffrey Ryan was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at PSC 8893, Box 3625\nAPO AE 94300 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Garza-Mullins should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Jeffrey Ryan at jean24@example.org or +403 0141252566. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at PSC 8893, Box 3625\nAPO AE 94300.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Garza-Mullins remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Bauer Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 6687 Henderson Tunnel Suite 948\nAndrewland, DC 74273.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Hoffman-Anderson, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 36478 Jarvis Drive Suite 362\nNorth Ashley, IA 93355.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

{"id": "utt_2560", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Williams LLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Williams LLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 8137 Anne Stravenue Apt. 940\nAdamview, MA 03753 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 058-29-2160 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Williams LLC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 8137 Anne Stravenue Apt. 940\nAdamview, MA 03753 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.davis.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 058-29-2160 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 058-29-2160, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Ruth Stewart was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 8137 Anne Stravenue Apt. 940\nAdamview, MA 03753 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Williams LLC should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Ruth Stewart at joshua88@example.net or +041 6975228151. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 8137 Anne Stravenue Apt. 940\nAdamview, MA 03753.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Williams LLC remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3417, "end": 3429, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5063, "end": 5075, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5079, "end": 5099, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5103, "end": 5118, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 906, "end": 953, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2056, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3675, "end": 3722, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5181, "end": 5228, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 92, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 430, "end": 442, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1972, "end": 1984, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4930, "end": 4942, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5284, "end": 5296, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Taylor and Sons, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 65314 Morales Glen\nSouth Rogermouth, SC 54096.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2596", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Lam-Garcia for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Lam-Garcia was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 215 Gregory Islands\nHullhaven, DC 99109 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 625-64-7426 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Lam-Garcia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 215 Gregory Islands\nHullhaven, DC 99109 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.cunningham.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 625-64-7426 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 625-64-7426, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Willie Mcintosh was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 215 Gregory Islands\nHullhaven, DC 99109 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Lam-Garcia should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Willie Mcintosh at timothy38@example.org or +83 4652780526. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 215 Gregory Islands\nHullhaven, DC 99109.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Lam-Garcia remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3401, "end": 3416, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5040, "end": 5055, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5059, "end": 5080, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5084, "end": 5098, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 902, "end": 941, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1995, "end": 2034, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3662, "end": 3701, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5161, "end": 5200, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 90, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 428, "end": 438, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1970, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4909, "end": 4919, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5256, "end": 5266, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Hoffman-Frye, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 5508 Johnson Mills Apt. 513\nLake Brittanyborough, NM 48282.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

{"id": "utt_2632", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Cook, Mcclain and Vazquez for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Cook, Mcclain and Vazquez was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 48560 Donald Road Apt 355\nRebeccahaven, RI 74233 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 500-52-9250 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Cook, Mcclain and Vazquez\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 48560 Donald Road Apt 355\nRebeccahaven, RI 74233 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://lambinfo/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 500-52-9250 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 500-52-9250, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Rhonda Johnson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 48560 Donald Road Apt. 355\nRebeccahaven, RI 74233 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Cook, Mcclain and Vazquez should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Rhonda Johnson at dhogan@example.net or +491 6095355315. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 48560 Donald Road Apt. 355\nRebeccahaven, RI 74233.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Cook, Mcclain and Vazquez remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Mason-Vance, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 353 Matthew Point Apt. 669\nTeresaton, FM 95949. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period.

{"id": "utt_2667", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Chandler Inc for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Chandler Inc are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial reporting process.

{"id": "utt_2668", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Green Group for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Green Group was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 732 Hall Mews\nNorth Mark, TN 27214 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 091-45-3566 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Green Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 732 Hall Mews\nNorth Mark, TN 27214 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://brown.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 091-45-3566 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 091-45-3566, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Nathan Kemp was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 732 Hall Mews\nNorth Mark, TN 27214 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Green Group should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Davis, Dixon and Frazier, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 8142 Horne Row Apt. 088\nGregorymouth, VI 91607.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2704", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Gray-Hill for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Gray-Hill was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at PSC 9524, Box 7585\nAPO AP 31719 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 055-20-2153 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Gray-Hill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at PSC 9524, Box 7585\nAPO AP 31719 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://schmidt-olson.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 055-20-2153 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 055-20-2153, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Arthur Barrett was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at PSC 9524, Box 7585\nAPO AP 31719 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Gray-Hill should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Arthur Barrett at theresa75@example.com or +91 4133384540. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at PSC 9524, Box 7585\nAPO AP 31719.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Gray-Hill remains compliant with all tax regulations.

In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Cox, Castro and Hayes, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 32401 Matthew Light\nWest Karenshire, OR 61732.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

{"id": "utt_2740", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Scott, Solis and Smith for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Scott, Solis and Smith was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 5168 Krista Junction\nSouth James, IN 52531 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 892-45-5382 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Scott, Solis and Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 5168 Krista Junction\nSouth James, IN 52531 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://huff-perez.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 892-45-5382 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 892-45-5382, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Shannon Cherry was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 5168 Krista Junction\nSouth James, IN 52531 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Scott, Solis and Smith should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Shannon Cherry at melissa17@example.net or +50 9769606527. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 5168 Krista Junction\nSouth James, IN 52531.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Scott, Solis and Smith remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3439, "end": 3453, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5092, "end": 5106, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5110, "end": 5131, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5135, "end": 5149, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 926, "end": 968, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2034, "end": 2076, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3699, "end": 3741, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5212, "end": 5254, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 102, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 440, "end": 462, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1987, "end": 2009, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4949, "end": 4971, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5310, "end": 5332, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Thompson, Moran and Ross, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 56623 Schmidt Run\nAndersonton, UT 64225.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2776", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Mayer-Wright for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Mayer-Wright was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 675 Martin Ford\nPort Haleystad, NE 84539 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 097-43-4562 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Mayer-Wright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 675 Martin Ford\nPort Haleystad, NE 84539 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://miller-moreno.net/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 097-43-4562 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 097-43-4562, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Debra Jones was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 675 Martin Ford\nPort Haleystad, NE 84539 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Mayer-Wright should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Debra Jones at ryan27@example.com or +91 7265127345. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 675 Martin Ford\nPort Haleystad, NE 84539.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Mayer-Wright remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3407, "end": 3418, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5045, "end": 5056, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5060, "end": 5078, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5082, "end": 5096, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 906, "end": 946, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2042, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3664, "end": 3704, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5159, "end": 5199, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 92, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 430, "end": 442, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1977, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4912, "end": 4924, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5255, "end": 5267, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Hoover-King, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 1149 Gary Walks\nSouth Stephanie, IA 40233.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2812", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Jones, Hernandez and Lloyd for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Jones, Hernandez and Lloyd was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 31448 Stuart Bridge\nEast Melissa, AL 72443 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 864-99-9881 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Jones, Hernandez and Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 31448 Stuart Bridge\nEast Melissa, AL 72443 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.sherman.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 864-99-9881 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 864-99-9881, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Alexander Castro was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 31448 Stuart Bridge\nEast Melissa, AL 72443 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Jones, Hernandez and Lloyd should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Alexander Castro at clarkbrenda@example.net or +91 7423622567. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 31448 Stuart Bridge\nEast Melissa, AL 72443.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Jones, Hernandez and Lloyd remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3452, "end": 3468, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5111, "end": 5127, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5131, "end": 5154, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5158, "end": 5172, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 934, "end": 976, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2088, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3714, "end": 3756, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5235, "end": 5277, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 106, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 444, "end": 470, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1995, "end": 2021, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4964, "end": 4990, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5333, "end": 5359, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Wagner LLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 4453 Michelle Burgs Apt. 557\nNorth Robertton, PW 85398.

The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at USNV Contreras\nFPO AE 75835 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties.

Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Mendoza, Parker and Craig, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 814 Matthew Cliff\nWest Amber, MP 70502.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2884", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Jordan-Johnson for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Jordan-Johnson was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 113 Schmidt Parkway Suite 154\nThompsonborough, VA 10039 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 700-50-4456 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Jordan-Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 113 Schmidt Parkway Suite 154\nThompsonborough, VA 10039 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://jones.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 700-50-4456 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 700-50-4456, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Daniel Rollins was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 113 Schmidt Parkway Suite 154\nThompsonborough, VA 10039 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Jordan-Johnson should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Daniel Rollins at janice85@example.com or +480 4526281458. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 113 Schmidt Parkway Suite 154\nThompsonborough, VA 10039.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Jordan-Johnson remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Jones, Odom and Williams, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 52324 Harris Islands\nDanielsbury, VA 00621.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Troy Pearson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 272 James Ridge\nLake Kristin, WI 54914 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Knight-Nelson should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Ferrell, Murray and Matthews, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 439 Byrd Burgs\nSheilaborough, NC 49375.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2956", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Jackson PLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Jackson PLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 32531 Kevin Hollow Apt. 896\nNew Monicaport, WY 20522 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 559-58-3859 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Jackson PLC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 32531 Kevin Hollow Apt. 896\nNew Monicaport, WY 20522 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://arroyo.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 559-58-3859 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 559-58-3859, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Veronica Smith was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 32531 Kevin Hollow Apt. 896\nNew Monicaport, WY 20522 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Jackson PLC should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Veronica Smith at ymccullough@example.net or +900 6752567968. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 32531 Kevin Hollow Apt. 896\nNew Monicaport, WY 20522.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Jackson PLC remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Mckenzie-Clark, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 60219 Gabriel Drive\nEast Ruthport, MH 89390.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_2992", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Jackson Inc for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Jackson Inc was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 26835 Sandy Cliff Apt. 291\nEast Derrick, LA 41106 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 723-13-3073 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Jackson Inc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 26835 Sandy Cliff Apt. 291\nEast Derrick, LA 41106 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://ferguson.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 723-13-3073 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 723-13-3073, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Jaclyn Washington was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 26835 Sandy Cliff Apt. 291\nEast Derrick, LA 41106 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Jackson Inc should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Jaclyn Washington at mccoyfaith@example.com or +76 8757686556. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 26835 Sandy Cliff Apt. 291\nEast Derrick, LA 41106.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Jackson Inc remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Smith Group, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 05068 Deborah Points\nJeffreyland, MD 74437.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_3028", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Davis-Lee for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Davis-Lee was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 7856 Shannon Villages Suite 019\nKramerport, GA 44801 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 247-69-1467 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Davis-Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 7856 Shannon Villages Suite 019\nKramerport, GA 44801 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://mcclure.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 247-69-1467 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 247-69-1467, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Vanessa Wilcox was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 7856 Shannon Villages Suite 019\nKramerport, GA 44801 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Davis-Lee should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Johnson Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at USNS Harmon\nFPO AA 69327.

In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Mcclure, Ashley and Carlson was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 5669 Cabrera Parkways Suite 180\nSkinnermouth, TX 10993 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 633-57-0692 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Mcclure, Ashley and Carlson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 5669 Cabrera Parkways Suite

capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://wwwhoward-chencom/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 633-57-0692 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 633-57-0692, were cross-checked with the HR records A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000 One such transaction involving a payment to Jimmy Jackson was identified where TDS was not deducted The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 5669 Cabrera Parkways Suite 180\nSkinnermouth, TX 10993 lacked proper documentation The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations The finance team at Mcclure, Ashley and Carlson should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Horne Inc, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 6865 Tara Viaduct Apt. 226\nNorth Jonathan, KS 15849.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_3100", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Williams, Martinez and Quinn for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Williams, Martinez and Quinn was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 310 Martin Place Suite 700\nSmithville, OR 00875 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 823-18-0918 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Williams, Martinez and Quinn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 310 Martin Place Suite 700\nSmithville, OR 00875 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.brown-arnold.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 823-18-0918 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 823-18-0918, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Stephanie Webb was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 310 Martin Place Suite 700\nSmithville, OR 00875 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Williams, Martinez and Quinn should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.
