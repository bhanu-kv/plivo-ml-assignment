These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements.

Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Lara, Rivers and Elliott, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 87942 Clarence River\nWest Brittney, LA 22279. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

{"id": "utt_43852", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Richardson-Stewart for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Richardson-Stewart was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 19238 Beth Forest\nPort Zachary, VA 34813 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 036-21-1219 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Richardson-Stewart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 19238 Beth Forest\nPort Zachary, VA 34813 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://gill.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 036-21-1219 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 036-21-1219, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Alex Lopez was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 19238 Beth Forest\nPort Zachary, VA 34813 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Richardson-Stewart should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Alex Lopez at lsalinas@example.org or +906 2407256713. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 19238 Beth Forest\nPort Zachary, VA 34813.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Richardson-Stewart remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3416, "end": 3426, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5059, "end": 5069, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5073, "end": 5093, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5097, "end": 5112, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 918, "end": 958, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2060, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3672, "end": 3712, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5175, "end": 5215, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 98, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 436, "end": 454, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1995, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4920, "end": 4938, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5271, "end": 5289, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

{"id": "utt_43887", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Steele PLC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Steele PLC are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial reporting process.

{"id": "utt_43888", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Young, Hawkins and Jones for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Young, Hawkins and Jones was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 9986 David Freeway\nLindaborough, DE 75003 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 237-33-4435 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Young, Hawkins and Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 9986 David Freeway\nLindaborough, DE 75003 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://hunter.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 237-33-4435 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 237-33-4435, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Amanda Gray was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 9986 David Freeway\nLindaborough, DE 75003 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Young, Hawkins and Jones should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Amanda Gray at vreed@example.org or +91 2216642692. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 9986 David Freeway\nLindaborough, DE 75003.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Young, Hawkins and Jones remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3438, "end": 3449, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5089, "end": 5100, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5104, "end": 5121, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5125, "end": 5139, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 930, "end": 971, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2039, "end": 2080, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3695, "end": 3736, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5202, "end": 5243, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 104, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 442, "end": 466, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 2014, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4944, "end": 4968, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5299, "end": 5323, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

{"id": "utt_43921", "text": "To The Members of Potts-Lawrence,\nReport on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\nKey Audit Matters Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 response to Key Audit Matters\nProperty, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets\nThere are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Potts-Lawrence, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 644 Christina Tunnel\nLake Lindseyshire, GU 51342. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

{"id": "utt_43923", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Wong PLC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_43924", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Flowers-Cummings for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Flowers-Cummings was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at USS Mccormick\nFPO AP 30243 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 455-01-7320 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Flowers-Cummings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at USS Mccormick\nFPO AP 30243 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.miller.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 455-01-7320 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 455-01-7320, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Sandra Burns was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at USS Mccormick\nFPO AP 30243 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Flowers-Cummings should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Sandra Burns at jacksonscott@example.org or +858 6575059517. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at USS Mccormick\nFPO AP 30243.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Flowers-Cummings remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3389, "end": 3401, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5018, "end": 5030, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5034, "end": 5058, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5062, "end": 5077, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 914, "end": 940, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2026, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3647, "end": 3673, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5140, "end": 5166, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 96, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 434, "end": 450, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1975, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4881, "end": 4897, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5222, "end": 5238, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

Employee details, including SSNs 662-11-2684, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Nathaniel Turner was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 333 Justin Squares\nDustinmouth, PR 01083 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Martinez, Jones and Tanner should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_43996", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Martinez PLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Martinez PLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 1497 Laura Brooks Apt. 715\nSouth Teresa, TN 42131 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 550-37-7241 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Martinez PLC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 1497 Laura Brooks Apt. 715\nSouth Teresa, TN 42131 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.thomas.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 550-37-7241 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 550-37-7241, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Justin Torres was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 1497 Laura Brooks Apt. 715\nSouth Teresa, TN 42131 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Martinez PLC should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Justin Torres at robertoroth@example.com or +31 4557377893. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 1497 Laura Brooks Apt. 715\nSouth Teresa, TN 42131.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Martinez PLC remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3422, "end": 3435, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5071, "end": 5084, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5088, "end": 5111, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5115, "end": 5129, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 906, "end": 955, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2060, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3681, "end": 3730, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5192, "end": 5241, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 92, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 430, "end": 442, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1986, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4938, "end": 4950, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5297, "end": 5309, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Brown, Rodriguez and Martin, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 82285 Dustin Port\nEast Cynthiaton, VA 92860.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

{"id": "utt_44068", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Reynolds, Gardner and Gardner for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Reynolds, Gardner and Gardner was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 6287 Watson Garden Apt. 738\nWest Jamieburgh, ND 04402 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 040-05-8448 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Reynolds, Gardner and Gardner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 6287 Watson Garden Apt. 738\nWest Jamieburgh, ND 04402 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.little.net/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 040-05-8448 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 040-05-8448, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Carrie Brown was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 6287 Watson Garden Apt. 738\nWest Jamieburgh, ND 04402 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Reynolds, Gardner and Gardner should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Carrie Brown at wwhite@example.net or +91 9573255954. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 6287 Watson Garden Apt. 738\nWest Jamieburgh, ND 04402.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Reynolds, Gardner and Gardner remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Grant LLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 0700 Cook Islands Suite 766\nStevensside, OH 58637.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44104", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Moore, Alexander and Johnson for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Moore, Alexander and Johnson was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 6557 Phillips Burg Apt. 980\nSouth Nicholastown, NC 02355 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 883-80-5015 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Moore, Alexander and Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 6557 Phillips Burg Apt. 980\nSouth Nicholastown, NC 02355 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://vang.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 883-80-5015 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 883-80-5015, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Walter Mcbride was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 6557 Phillips Burg Apt. 980\nSouth Nicholastown, NC 02355 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Moore, Alexander and Johnson should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Walter Mcbride at candaceyoung@example.net or +150 0253670726. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 6557 Phillips Burg Apt. 980\nSouth Nicholastown, NC 02355.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Moore, Alexander and Johnson remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3478, "end": 3492, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5151, "end": 5165, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5169, "end": 5193, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5197, "end": 5212, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 938, "end": 994, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2066, "end": 2122, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3738, "end": 3794, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5275, "end": 5331, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 108, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 446, "end": 474, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2041, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5002, "end": 5030, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5387, "end": 5415, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Medina, Hudson and Gutierrez, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 2340 Preston Trace\nGilbertmouth, AZ 09434.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics.

The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Robbins Ltd should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Collins, Ball and Murray, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 5259 Maria Shore Suite 163\nLake Justin, CT 29365.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44176", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Sandoval-Chavez for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Sandoval-Chavez was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 777 Peggy Station\nNew Christopherstad, TN 72004 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 021-17-7043 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Sandoval-Chavez\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 777 Peggy Station\nNew Christopherstad, TN 72004 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://wolf.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 021-17-7043 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 021-17-7043, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Caroline Walker was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 777 Peggy Station\nNew Christopherstad, TN 72004 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Sandoval-Chavez should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Caroline Walker at reginaldmoore@example.org or +64 8988785119.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Friedman-Proctor are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

{"id": "utt_44212", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Peterson-Ramos for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Peterson-Ramos was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 6550 Jennifer Village Apt. 921\nPetersonbury, IA 59331 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 417-96-5445 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Peterson-Ramos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 6550 Jennifer Village Apt. 921\nPetersonbury, IA 59331 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://white.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 417-96-5445 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 417-96-5445, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Spencer Sullivan was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 6550 Jennifer Village Apt. 921\nPetersonbury, IA 59331 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Peterson-Ramos should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Spencer Sullivan at josephgilbert@example.org or +357 1394585593. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 6550 Jennifer Village Apt. 921\nPetersonbury, IA 59331.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Peterson-Ramos remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3433, "end": 3449, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5091, "end": 5107, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5111, "end": 5136, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5140, "end": 5155, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 910, "end": 963, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2021, "end": 2074, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3695, "end": 3748, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5218, "end": 5271, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 94, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 432, "end": 446, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1996, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4956, "end": 4970, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5327, "end": 5341, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Marshall, Navarro and Pittman, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 67447 Alexis Creek\nMichaeltown, AZ 23851.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Savage, Bridges and Padilla, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 39370 Young Light Apt. 132\nJacobsonborough, CO 45005. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period.

{"id": "utt_44284", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Garcia and Sons for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Garcia and Sons was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 2423 Simmons Lights\nAliciaview, OR 95566 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 200-93-1017 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Garcia and Sons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 2423 Simmons Lights\nAliciaview, OR 95566 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://rodriguez-ramirez.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 200-93-1017 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 200-93-1017, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Wayne Gomez was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 2423 Simmons Lights\nAliciaview, OR 95566 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Garcia and Sons should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Wayne Gomez at tjones@example.org or +31 8636511581. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 2423 Simmons Lights\nAliciaview, OR 95566.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Garcia and Sons remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3420, "end": 3431, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5061, "end": 5072, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5076, "end": 5094, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5098, "end": 5112, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 912, "end": 952, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2051, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3677, "end": 3717, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5175, "end": 5215, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 95, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 433, "end": 448, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1986, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4925, "end": 4940, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5271, "end": 5286, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Gomez-Thompson, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 4124 Melissa Turnpike\nBrownfort, MT 66667. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period.

{"id": "utt_44319", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of King, Thomas and Ferguson for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of King, Thomas and Ferguson are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial reporting process.

{"id": "utt_44320", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Gonzalez-Paul for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Gonzalez-Paul was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 36275 Ward Grove Apt. 811\nReginaldport, OH 49246 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 474-87-2766 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Gonzalez-Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 36275 Ward Grove Apt. 811\nReginaldport, OH 49246 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://weaver.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 474-87-2766 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 474-87-2766, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Steve Blankenship was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 36275 Ward Grove Apt. 811\nReginaldport, OH 49246 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Gonzalez-Paul should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Steve Blankenship at smithalexis@example.net or +286 4066000200. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 36275 Ward Grove Apt. 811\nReginaldport, OH 49246.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Gonzalez-Paul remains compliant with all tax regulations.

Employee details, including SSNs 092-51-7810, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Ashley Smith was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 437 Lindsey Manors Apt. 977\nNew Calvinville, AR 15102 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Ramirez-Webb should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Beasley-Barajas, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 331 Bryant Stravenue Suite 666\nAlexanderville, PA 89220.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44392", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Fowler, Jenkins and Long for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Fowler, Jenkins and Long was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 7938 Nolan Mews\nJessicastad, AZ 73148 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 595-93-1336 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Fowler, Jenkins and Long\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 7938 Nolan Mews\nJessicastad, AZ 73148 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://cruz.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 595-93-1336 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 595-93-1336, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Travis Greene was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 7938 Nolan Mews\nJessicastad, AZ 73148 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Fowler, Jenkins and Long should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Travis Greene at masseyjeremy@example.org or +87 0393865678. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 7938 Nolan Mews\nJessicastad, AZ 73148.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Fowler, Jenkins and Long remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3429, "end": 3442, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5078, "end": 5091, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5095, "end": 5119, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5123, "end": 5137, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 930, "end": 967, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2072, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3688, "end": 3725, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5200, "end": 5237, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 104, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 442, "end": 466, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 2010, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4933, "end": 4957, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5293, "end": 5317, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Ruiz-Baker, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 8917 Chavez Dale Suite 520\nSouth Michaelberg, DE 22454.

The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44428", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Cruz, Vaughn and Pacheco for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Cruz, Vaughn and Pacheco was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 3192 Michael Loaf Apt. 373\nNathanview, TX 06838 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 678-96-6229 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Cruz, Vaughn and Pacheco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 3192 Michael Loaf Apt. 373\nNathanview, TX 06838 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://fleming-harris.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 678-96-6229 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 678-96-6229, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Miranda Hernandez was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 3192 Michael Loaf Apt. 373\nNathanview, TX 06838 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Cruz, Vaughn and Pacheco should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Miranda Hernandez at david76@example.org or +044 4162050449. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 3192 Michael Loaf Apt. 373\nNathanview, TX 06838.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Cruz, Vaughn and Pacheco remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Williams, Hawkins and Clarke, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 754 Rachael Streets Apt. 816\nLake Tanya, FM 36179.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44464", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Stout Inc for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Stout Inc was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 990 Mary Extension Suite 108\nJadefort, CA 38537 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 274-21-5465 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Stout Inc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 990 Mary Extension Suite 108\nJadefort, CA 38537 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.wang-morales.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 274-21-5465 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 274-21-5465, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Jessica Jones was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 990 Mary Extension Suite 108\nJadefort, CA 38537 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Stout Inc should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Jessica Jones at dennis41@example.com or +24 3817123259. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 990 Mary Extension Suite 108\nJadefort, CA 38537.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Stout Inc remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Dudley, Sanders and Carr, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 23775 Hunter Land\nPort Scott, NY 95044.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44500", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Brown-Hurst for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Brown-Hurst was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 646 Williams Falls Suite 178\nSmithport, NH 24669 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 501-35-0870 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Brown-Hurst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 646 Williams Falls Suite 178\nSmithport, NH 24669 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://tucker-griffin.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 501-35-0870 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 501-35-0870, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Alicia Zuniga was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 646 Williams Falls Suite 178\nSmithport, NH 24669 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Brown-Hurst should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Alicia Zuniga at ssawyer@example.org or +035 0709526796. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 646 Williams Falls Suite 178\nSmithport, NH 24669.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Brown-Hurst remains compliant with all tax regulations.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 895-64-2949 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 895-64-2949, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Amanda Stanley was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 699 Villa Valleys Apt. 477\nEricborough, LA 63783 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Wright-Morrow should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Jones, Robinson and Scott, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at USCGC Harris\nFPO AP 43073.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44572", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Thomas, Cooper and Young for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Thomas, Cooper and Young was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 1115 Haas Meadow Apt. 722\nWest Michele, GA 24538 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 695-01-2265 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Thomas, Cooper and Young\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 1115 Haas Meadow Apt. 722\nWest Michele, GA 24538 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://cook-sims.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 695-01-2265 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 695-01-2265, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Karla Wood was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 1115 Haas Meadow Apt. 722\nWest Michele, GA 24538 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Thomas, Cooper and Young should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Karla Wood at jessica45@example.com or +944 3049889139.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Anderson-Miller, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 50969 Simpson Ferry Suite 140\nReneetown, ME 49954.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44608", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Poole, Thompson and Mason for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Poole, Thompson and Mason was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 12599 Reeves Cove Apt. 130\nPort Karen, MD 59662 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 202-85-6987 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Poole, Thompson and Mason\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 12599 Reeves Cove Apt. 130\nPort Karen, MD 59662 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.warner.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 202-85-6987 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 202-85-6987, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Oscar Bell was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 12599 Reeves Cove Apt. 130\nPort Karen, MD 59662 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Poole, Thompson and Mason should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Oscar Bell at ebell@example.com or +40 1142945415. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 12599 Reeves Cove Apt. 130\nPort Karen, MD 59662.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Poole, Thompson and Mason remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3458, "end": 3468, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5115, "end": 5125, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5129, "end": 5146, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5150, "end": 5164, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 932, "end": 979, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2095, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3714, "end": 3761, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5227, "end": 5274, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 105, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 443, "end": 468, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2023, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4969, "end": 4994, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5330, "end": 5355, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Chandler-Hoffman, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 7936 Joshua River\nBateston, CT 41432.

{"id": "utt_44644", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Christensen-Smith for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Christensen-Smith was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 5199 Joshua Spur\nRyanland, NC 56007 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 897-01-4054 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Christensen-Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 5199 Joshua Spur\nRyanland, NC 56007 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://moon.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 897-01-4054 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 897-01-4054, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Robert Costa was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 5199 Joshua Spur\nRyanland, NC 56007 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Christensen-Smith should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Robert Costa at william70@example.com or +44 4216998328. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 5199 Joshua Spur\nRyanland, NC 56007.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Christensen-Smith remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3403, "end": 3415, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5042, "end": 5054, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5058, "end": 5079, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5083, "end": 5097, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 916, "end": 951, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2047, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3661, "end": 3696, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5160, "end": 5195, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 97, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 435, "end": 452, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1970, "end": 1987, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4904, "end": 4921, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5251, "end": 5268, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management.

Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Jackson-Good was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 2928 Jenny Islands Apt. 151\nNew Devinbury, MP 22007 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 031-89-1888 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Jackson-Good\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 2928 Jenny Islands Apt. 151\nNew Devinbury, MP 22007 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://beard.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 031-89-1888 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 031-89-1888, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Jennifer Rodriguez was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 2928 Jenny Islands Apt. 151\nNew Devinbury, MP 22007 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Jackson-Good should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Jennifer Rodriguez at panderson@example.org or +91 4196503804. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 2928 Jenny Islands Apt. 151\nNew Devinbury, MP 22007.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Jackson-Good remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3421, "end": 3439, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5077, "end": 5095, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5099, "end": 5120, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5124, "end": 5138, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 906, "end": 957, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2064, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3685, "end": 3736, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5201, "end": 5252, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 92, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 430, "end": 442, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1988, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4944, "end": 4956, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5308, "end": 5320, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Mclean Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 7541 Richardson Drives Suite 773\nStephenfort, VT 87181.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

{"id": "utt_44716", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Brown LLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Brown LLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at USCGC Bradley\nFPO AE 73900 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 718-62-8100 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Brown LLC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at USCGC Bradley\nFPO AE 73900 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.rhodes-hayes.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 718-62-8100 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 718-62-8100, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Kelly Duarte was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at USCGC Bradley\nFPO AE 73900 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Brown LLC should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Kelly Duarte at anthonybaker@example.net or +09 6935214060. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at USCGC Bradley\nFPO AE 73900.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Brown LLC remains compliant with all tax regulations.

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

{"id": "utt_44752", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Mendez-Stewart for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Mendez-Stewart was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at PSC 8925, Box 3387\nAPO AE 85730 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 476-59-3995 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Mendez-Stewart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at PSC 8925, Box 3387\nAPO AE 85730 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.cox.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 476-59-3995 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 476-59-3995, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Robin Murphy was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at PSC 8925, Box 3387\nAPO AE 85730 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Mendez-Stewart should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Robin Murphy at carol87@example.net or +14 8585089001. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at PSC 8925, Box 3387\nAPO AE 85730.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Mendez-Stewart remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3389, "end": 3401, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5021, "end": 5033, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5037, "end": 5056, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5060, "end": 5074, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 910, "end": 941, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2030, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3647, "end": 3678, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5137, "end": 5168, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 94, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 432, "end": 446, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1974, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4886, "end": 4900, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5224, "end": 5238, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Elliott-Hood, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 546 Wright Green\nAngelaside, AK 84925. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Act\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics.

{"id": "utt_44787", "text": "Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Parker LLC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Parker LLC are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

{"id": "utt_44788", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Tate, Medina and Stephens for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Tate, Medina and Stephens was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 486 Joseph Islands Apt. 707\nNew Nathanmouth, OR 65413 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 249-27-3845 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Tate, Medina and Stephens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 486 Joseph Islands Apt. 707\nNew Nathanmouth, OR 65413 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.morales.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 249-27-3845 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 249-27-3845, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Brandon Freeman was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 486 Joseph Islands Apt. 707\nNew Nathanmouth, OR 65413 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Tate, Medina and Stephens should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 486 Joseph Islands Apt. 707\nNew Nathanmouth, OR 65413.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Tate, Medina and Stephens remains compliant with all tax regulations.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44824", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by May-Miller for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for May-Miller was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 15950 Kelly Lodge\nNorth Joseph, SC 86689 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 351-38-8224 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for May-Miller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 15950 Kelly Lodge\nNorth Joseph, SC 86689 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.bush.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 351-38-8224 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 351-38-8224, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Tina Hernandez was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 15950 Kelly Lodge\nNorth Joseph, SC 86689 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at May-Miller should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Tina Hernandez at renee75@example.net or +91 5479525681. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 15950 Kelly Lodge\nNorth Joseph, SC 86689.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that May-Miller remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.\n\n", "entities": [{"start": 3397, "end": 3411, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5036, "end": 5050, "label": "PERSON_NAME"}, {"start": 5054, "end": 5073, "label": "EMAIL"}, {"start": 5077, "end": 5091, "label": "PHONE"}, {"start": 902, "end": 942, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2036, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 3657, "end": 3697, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5154, "end": 5194, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 80, "end": 90, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 428, "end": 438, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1971, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 4905, "end": 4915, "label": "LOCATION"}, {"start": 5250, "end": 5260, "label": "LOCATION"}]}

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Meyer and Sons, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 1385 Henry Views\nKatherinemouth, UT 96104.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44860", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Smith Inc for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Smith Inc was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 09083 Gregory Greens Suite 473\nJosephberg, LA 51993 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 634-06-8531 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Smith Inc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 09083 Gregory Greens Suite 473\nJosephberg, LA 51993 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://mills-gamble.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 634-06-8531 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 634-06-8531, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Jose Watson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 09083 Gregory Greens Suite 473\nJosephberg, LA 51993 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Smith Inc should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Jose Watson at iwood@example.net or +240 9311576211. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 09083 Gregory Greens Suite 473\nJosephberg, LA 51993.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Smith Inc remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Perry LLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 763 Marie Roads Apt. 210\nBrandonland, NH 87794.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

{"id": "utt_44932", "text": "We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Bell-Morgan for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Tax Overview\nThe corporate tax computation for Bell-Morgan was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.\n\nKey points include:\n\nDepreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 7588 Carolyn Knolls\nNew Meganfurt, NJ 37238 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.\n\nTax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.\n\nDeductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 403-26-8771 end with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc4567\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.\n\nGST Compliance\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:\n\nGST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Bell-Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing unit at 7588 Carolyn Knolls\nNew Meganfurt, NJ 37238 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.\n\nInput Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.wolfe.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.\n\nReconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 403-26-8771 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.\n\nWithholding Tax (TDS)\nWithholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:\n\nSalaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 403-26-8771, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1234\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.\n\nProfessional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Jeremiah Taylor was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.\n\nRent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 7588 Carolyn Knolls\nNew Meganfurt, NJ 37238 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.\n\nAudit Recommendations\nBased on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:\n\nTimely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.\n\nDocumentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Bell-Morgan should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Jeremiah Taylor at sarahmora@example.org or +60 7384891577. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 7588 Carolyn Knolls\nNew Meganfurt, NJ 37238.\n\nThis review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Bell-Morgan remains compliant with all tax regulations.

These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.\nWe assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Lewis, Castillo and West, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 528 Turner Extension Apt. 411\nWest Theresabury, NH 89497.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and \"the Rules\" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Code of Ethics.

Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.\n\nEmployee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.\n\nAutomation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.\n\nConclusion\nWe have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Klein-Hudson should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.
